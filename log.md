# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Friday January 3, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Start Learning Basic Javascript

**Thoughts:** Basic Javasscript is very easy so far. I learned C programming before. Some of the syntax are different but the basic concept is the same I have gone through 30 % of the course in an hour so I hope to finish the basic soon to go through algorithm, data structure and object oriented programming. I hope to practice code for interview purposes and finally to start my own project soon!!!

### Day 1: Saturday January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learned basic Java and intro to object oriented programming

**Thoughts** I want to learn Java because my course for next semester will be learning OOB programming, so I want to be ready for it. To be honest OOB is pretty new to me so I still have a lot to learn. I also found a lot of resources I can learn progrmaming for free.

### Day 2: Saturday January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I learned basic Java and intro to object oriented programming

**Thoughts** Still learning. A bit boring beccause it is similar to C. How to make this more challenging? I found new source that teach OOB programming. Migh try it out after codeacademy for practice. Look similar to what I have larned in code academy though.
