**Today's Progress**: Start Learning Basic Javascript

**Thoughts:** Basic Javasscript is very easy so far. I learned C programming before. Some of the syntax are different but the basic concept is the same I have gone through 30 % of the course in an hour so I hope to finish the basic soon to go through algorithm, data structure and object oriented programming. I hope to practice code for interview purposes and finally to start my own project soon!!!

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
